is in that first kiss.

- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I think, for us...

8
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,022
...kissing is pretty much
like an opening act.

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,774
I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian

Bring back the comedian.

345
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,209
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

346
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,174
You know, if you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes...

347
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,635
...it kind of looks like an old potato.

348
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,055
Then don't do that, all right?

349
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,475
Monica?

350
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,227
What do you think?

351
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,895
Mm-hm.

352
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,523
Are you welling up?

353
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,983
- No.
- You are.

354
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,444
- You are. You're welling up.
- No, I'm not.

355
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,780
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

356
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,408
Hi, Mindy.

357
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,702
Hi, it's Rachel.

358
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,706
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

359
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,583
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.

360
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,502
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

361
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:21,381
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

362
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,760
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

363
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,097
...and you guys end up getting
married and having kids and everything...

364
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:32,684
...I just hope they have his
old hairline and your old nose.

365
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:40,984
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
